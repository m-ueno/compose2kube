To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you need to create several Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Service, and PersistentVolumeClaim. Below is an example conversion of the given Compose file. Note that certain features in Docker Compose do not have direct equivalents in Kubernetes, such as `depends_on`, `cap_add`, and `security_opt`; these may require additional configuration or changes in your Kubernetes cluster setup.

Please replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the actual values you want to use in your Kubernetes manifests.

First, create a Deployment manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: app-src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: app-configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - "cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/log
      - name: app-src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/app_container/src
      - name: app-configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/add_components/websocket_sv
```

Next, create a Service manifest for each port:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-gui-service
spec:
  type: NodePort # Change this to LoadBalancer if you're on a cloud provider
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8002
    targetPort: 8002
    nodePort: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-wss-service
spec:
  type: NodePort # Change this to LoadBalancer if you're on a cloud provider
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 5003
    targetPort: 5003
    nodePort: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
```

Lastly, you'll need a PersistentVolumeClaim for the `workspace_app` volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Specify the size of the volume
```

Please note the following:

- The `depends_on` directive has no equivalent in Kubernetes. Instead, you should use readiness and liveness probes to manage dependencies.
- The `cap_add` and `security_opt` options are not directly supported in Kubernetes. The `privileged` flag in the `securityContext` is used in this example to grant extended privileges, but you should ensure this is acceptable for your use case and security policies.
- The `volumes` using `hostPath` are mapped to a directory on the host. This is not recommended for production deployments. Instead, you should use PersistentVolumes that are backed by appropriate storage solutions.
- Replace `/path/to/your/local/` with the actual host paths for your volume data if you use `hostPath`.

You may need to adjust the manifests to suit your specific environment, especially concerning storage, networking, and security policies.
