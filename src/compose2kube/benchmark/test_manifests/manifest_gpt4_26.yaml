To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, we'll need to create several Kubernetes resources, such as a Deployment, Service, and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). Please note that the conversion process might not be one-to-one, as Kubernetes has different concepts and configurations compared to Docker Compose.

Here's an example conversion of the Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: act-sdk-exec
          image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
          tty: true
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8002 # serverアプリとの通信
            - containerPort: 5003 # Websocketとの通信
          env:
            - name: PYTHONPATH
              value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: workspace-app
              mountPath: /workspace/app
            - name: log-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
            - name: src-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/src
            - name: configs-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
            - name: websocket-sv-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add:
                - SYS_ADMIN
            seccompProfile:
              type: Unconfined
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
        - name: workspace-app
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: workspace-app-pvc
        # Host volumes are not recommended in Kubernetes for production use. The following entries are just for example.
        - name: log-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/host/log
        - name: src-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/host/app_container/src
        - name: configs-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/host/app_container/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/host/add_components/websocket_sv
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - name: gui
      protocol: TCP
      port: 8002
      targetPort: 8002
    - name: websocket
      protocol: TCP
      port: 5003
      targetPort: 5003
  type: NodePort # or LoadBalancer if you're on a cloud provider that supports it
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust the size as needed
```

Please replace the `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` placeholders with actual values from your environment. Also, replace the `/path/to/host/...` with the actual host paths you want to map, but keep in mind that using `hostPath` is not recommended for production workloads in Kubernetes.

For the `depends_on` feature, you'll need to ensure that your `act-sdk-app` service (not provided in your Docker Compose) is also converted to Kubernetes manifests and that it's running before `act-sdk-exec`. Kubernetes doesn't have a direct equivalent to `depends_on`, but you can manage dependencies using Init Containers or by defining readiness and liveness probes for your containers to ensure they are started in the correct order.

The environment variable placeholders like `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` should also be replaced with actual values or handled using ConfigMaps or Secrets in Kubernetes.

Lastly, the `cap_add` and `security_opt` options don't have direct equivalents in Kubernetes. You might need to adjust your security context to grant the necessary permissions, as I've included in the `securityContext` field, but you should carefully consider the security implications of doing so.
