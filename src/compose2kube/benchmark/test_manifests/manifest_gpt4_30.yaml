To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you can use the following Kubernetes objects: Deployment, Service, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim. Below are the Kubernetes manifests created from the provided Docker Compose file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /path/to/your/local/workspace_app # Replace with the actual path on your host

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - name: gui
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8002
    - name: wss
      protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 5003
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Replace the `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` placeholders with the actual values for your container image. Also, replace the host paths for volumes with the actual paths where your local data resides. Note that hostPath volumes are for single-node testing only. In a multi-node cluster, you would use a different volume type that is accessible to all nodes.

For the service, I've mapped the ports `8002` and `5003` to `80` and `443`, respectively, which are common ports for HTTP and HTTPS. Adjust the `port` values according to your requirements.

Please be aware that you should avoid running containers with elevated privileges like `SYS_ADMIN` and `seccomp:unconfined` in a production environment due to security concerns. This example demonstrates how to convert the Docker Compose configuration, but for a production deployment, you should consider minimizing the security privileges required by your containers.

To apply these manifests to your Kubernetes cluster, you would save the YAML to a file and use `kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml`. Remember to replace placeholders and paths to match your environment before applying the manifests.
