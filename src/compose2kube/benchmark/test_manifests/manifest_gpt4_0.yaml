To convert the provided Docker Compose file snippet into Kubernetes manifests, you'll need to create a few different Kubernetes objects, including a Deployment, Service, and PersistentVolumeClaim. The following is a basic example of what the resulting Kubernetes manifests might look like. Note that you will need to replace the environment variable placeholders (like `${REGISTRY}` and `${REPOSITORY}`) with actual values before applying the manifests to your Kubernetes cluster.

Please adjust the following manifests to match your specific requirements and environment configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: <registry>/<repository>/<main-exec-image> # Replace with actual values
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # GUI_FWD_PORT
        - containerPort: 5003 # WSS_FWD_PORT
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/log # Replace with actual path
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/src # Replace with actual path
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/configs # Replace with actual path
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv # Replace with actual path
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8002 # GUI_FWD_PORT
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 5003 # WSS_FWD_PORT
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust size as needed
```

In this example, the following Kubernetes objects are created:
- A Deployment named `act-sdk-exec-deployment`, which defines the desired state of the application including the image to be run, environment variables, volumes, and security context. The `tty: true` setting is translated into `stdin: true` and `tty: true` in the container spec.
- A Service named `act-sdk-exec-service`, which defines how to access the application using a stable IP address within the Kubernetes cluster.
- A PersistentVolumeClaim named `workspace-app-pvc`, which requests a persistent volume for the `workspace_app` volume defined in the Compose file. The `hostPath` volumes are translated as well, but you need to replace the paths with the actual paths on your Kubernetes node where the data should be stored.

Please note:
- The `depends_on` field from the Docker Compose file is not directly translatable to Kubernetes, as Kubernetes handles inter-container dependencies differently, often through readiness checks.
- The environment variables for the port numbers and image details must be replaced with actual values.
- The `security_opt` and `cap_add` fields have been translated to the security context of the container. However, granting `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities and setting the seccomp profile to "unconfined" can be a security risk and should be carefully considered before use.
- You may need to set up proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) depending on the permissions required by your application.
- Persistent volume handling in Kubernetes is more complex than in Docker Compose. You may need to configure a StorageClass or specify a particular PersistentVolume depending on your cluster setup.
- The paths for `hostPath` volumes must exist on the node where the pod gets scheduled, and this type of volume can have different implications for a multi-node cluster. You should consider using a more appropriate persistent storage solution if your application will be deployed in a multi-node environment.
