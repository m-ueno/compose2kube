To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you would need to create several different Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PersistentVolumeClaim, etc. Below are the Kubernetes manifests that correspond to the given Docker Compose service definition. 

Please take note that Kubernetes does not directly support all Docker Compose fields, so some fields like `depends_on`, `tty`, `cap_add`, and `security_opt` don't have a direct translation to Kubernetes and are omitted or require alternative approaches.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
          name: gui-port
        - containerPort: 5003
          name: wss-port
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/log
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/local/add_components/websocket_sv

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
```

Please replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the appropriate values for your environment. For host volumes, replace `/path/to/your/local/...` with the actual paths on your host where you want to mount the volumes.

Note: 
- The `depends_on` field has no direct equivalent in Kubernetes. Dependencies are typically managed by readiness probes and startup ordering.
- Capabilities such as `SYS_ADMIN` and security options like `seccomp:unconfined` need to be addressed with security contexts and may require cluster-level settings or specific policies.
- PersistentVolumeClaim is used for the named volume `workspace_app`. For the bind mounts, I've assumed you want to use `hostPath` for simplicity, but you might want to use a different persistent storage solution in a production environment.
- You should create a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` to store configurations and sensitive data, if necessary.
- The `tty: true` directive is typically used for debugging and is not necessary for production deployments in Kubernetes. If you need a TTY for a container, that can be specified in the container spec under `stdin` and `tty`.
- Make sure to configure the appropriate `resources` limits and requests for CPU and memory according to your application's needs.

Remember to apply these manifests to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`.
