To convert the provided Docker Compose file into Kubernetes manifests, you can create several Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Service, PersistentVolumeClaim, and ConfigMap. Below is an example of how these might be translated. Note that the environment variables such as `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` should be replaced with actual values or handled through ConfigMaps/Secrets.

First, let's create a PersistentVolumeClaim for the workspace storage:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
```

Next, let's create a ConfigMap for holding the configuration files:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-config
data:
  # Add your configurations here in key-value format
---
```

Now, let's create the Deployment that will define the `act-sdk_exec` service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec-container
        image: <REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY>/<MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE> # Replace with actual values
        tty: true
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
          seLinuxOptions: {} # You might need to adjust this depending on your security requirements
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # Replace with actual GUI_FWD_PORT value
        - containerPort: 5003 # Replace with actual WSS_FWD_PORT value
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        # Mount other volumes as needed
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # Define other volumes here
  restartPolicy: Always
---
```

Finally, let's define a Service to expose the ports:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: 8002 # Replace with actual GUI_FWD_PORT value
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss
    port: 5003 # Replace with actual WSS_FWD_PORT value
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
---
```

Remember to create the necessary ConfigMaps and Secrets to handle your configuration files and environment variables. Also, you will need to adjust the PersistentVolumeClaim and the volume mounts to match your specific storage requirements.

This is a simplified example and might need further customization based on your specific needs, such as setting up the correct security context, handling environment variables, and adjusting resource requests and limits for the containers.
