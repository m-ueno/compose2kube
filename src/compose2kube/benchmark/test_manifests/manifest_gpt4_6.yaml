To convert the given Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you would need to create a deployment for the `act-sdk_exec` service and a persistent volume claim for the `workspace_app` volume. Also, Kubernetes doesn't support `cap_add` or `security_opt` directly, so you might need to adjust the security context of the pod accordingly. Below is a rough translation of the Compose file into Kubernetes YAML manifests.

Please replace the placeholders `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with their actual values before using the manifests.

```

Please note the following:
- The `depends_on` directive is not supported in Kubernetes. Dependencies need to be managed through readiness and liveness probes or by ensuring that services are available before starting dependent ones.
- The `cap_add` and `security_opt` options are not directly translatable to Kubernetes. You may need to run the pod with elevated privileges by setting `privileged: true` in the security context, but this is generally not recommended for security reasons.
- The `volumes` are mapped to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and host paths. You will need to ensure that the PersistentVolume (PV) exists and is bound to the PVC. The host paths should be replaced with the actual paths on the node where Kubernetes is running.
- The `ports` are exposed through a Kubernetes Service of type `ClusterIP`. If you need to expose the ports externally, you might want to use a different service type like `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.

Please adjust the manifests further to match your exact requirements and environment.
