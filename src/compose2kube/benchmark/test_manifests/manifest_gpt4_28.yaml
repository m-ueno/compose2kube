To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you will need to create a set of Kubernetes resources such as a Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PersistentVolumeClaim, etc. Below is an example of what those Kubernetes manifests could look like, with placeholders for the variable parts that you'll need to replace with actual values.

Keep in mind that this is a basic conversion and does not account for all aspects of your environment, such as Persistent Volumes for the volumes defined in the Docker Compose file, and ConfigMaps or Secrets for environment variables and other configurations.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: <REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY>/<MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE>
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # replace with the value of ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
        - containerPort: 5003 # replace with the value of ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seLinuxOptions: {}
          runAsUser: <USER_ID> # You need to specify the user ID if needed
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log # replace with the path on the host
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/src # replace with the path on the host
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/configs # replace with the path on the host
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/websocket_sv # replace with the path on the host

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: <GUI_FWD_PORT> # replace with the value of ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss
    port: <WSS_FWD_PORT> # replace with the value of ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # specify the size of the volume
```

Here's what the conversion does:

1. It creates a Deployment with a single replica for the `act-sdk_exec` service.
2. It defines a Service to expose the specified ports.
3. It specifies a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to create a persistent volume for the `workspace_app` volume mentioned in the Compose file.

Please replace the placeholders like `<REGISTRY>`, `<REPOSITORY>`, `<MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE>`, `<USER_ID>`, and other placeholders (e.g., `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, `${WSS_FWD_PORT}`) with actual values.

For the `log`, `src`, `configs`, and `websocket-sv` volumes, I've assumed that you want to mount these from the host file system. If these should be persistent across pod restarts, you would need to create PersistentVolumes or use another type of volume that suits your needs.

Make sure to adjust the security context and any other configurations to match the requirements of your application and Kubernetes cluster security policies.

This is a starting point, and depending on your specific requirements and Kubernetes environment, further customizations may be necessary.
