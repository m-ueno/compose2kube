To convert the given Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you need to create several different Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims, ConfigMaps, and possibly others depending on your specific needs.

Here's an example of how to convert the provided Compose service into Kubernetes manifests. Please note that environment variables such as `REGISTRY`, `REPOSITORY`, `MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE`, `GUI_FWD_PORT`, and `WSS_FWD_PORT` need to be replaced with actual values or passed as environment variables to the Kubernetes deployment.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # You would need to specify appropriate storage size

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  type: NodePort # Or LoadBalancer if you are on a cloud provider
  ports:
    - name: gui
      port: 8002 # Replace with the value of GUI_FWD_PORT
      targetPort: 8002
    - name: websocket
      port: 5003 # Replace with the value of WSS_FWD_PORT
      targetPort: 5003
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: act-sdk-exec
          image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE} # Replace with actual image
          tty: true
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8002
            - containerPort: 5003
          env:
            - name: PYTHONPATH
              value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: workspace-app
              mountPath: /workspace/app
            - name: log
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
            - name: app-src
              mountPath: /workspace/app/src
            - name: app-configs
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
            - name: websocket-sv
              mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
            seccompProfile:
              type: Unconfined
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
        - name: workspace-app
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: workspace-app-pvc
        # The following `emptyDir` and `hostPath` volumes are used for simplicity
        # In production, you would want to use a more appropriate volume type
        - name: log
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: app-src
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/your/app_container/src
        - name: app-configs
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/your/app_container/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/your/add_components/websocket_sv

# Add more Kubernetes manifests as needed for other services and volumes
```

Keep in mind that hostPath volumes are suitable for single-node testing but are not recommended for production use. Instead, consider using PersistentVolumes or other storage classes that are appropriate for your cluster.

Also, the `depends_on` directive is not directly translatable to Kubernetes, so you need to manage inter-service dependencies through other means, such as init containers, readiness probes, or manually ensuring that dependencies are met before deploying dependent services.

Make sure to replace the placeholders with actual values and adjust the configurations to match your specific use case and environment. You may also need to create ConfigMaps or Secrets to handle configuration files and sensitive data.
