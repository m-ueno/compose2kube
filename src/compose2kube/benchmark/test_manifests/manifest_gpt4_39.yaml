Converting a Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests involves several steps. For each service defined in the Docker Compose file, we need to create a corresponding Kubernetes deployment and service. Additionally, since you have defined volumes in your Compose file, we will need to provision persistent volumes and persistent volume claims for stateful data.

Here is a basic conversion of your Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec-container
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
          name: gui-port
        - containerPort: 5003
          name: wss-port
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # Note: For hostPath or local volumes, you need to configure the below volumes accordingly.
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log  # Replace with actual path on host
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/src  # Replace with actual path on host
      - name: config-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs  # Replace with actual path on host
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv  # Replace with actual path on host

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8002
    targetPort: 8002
    nodePort: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
  - name: wss-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 5003
    targetPort: 5003
    nodePort: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
```

Please note the following:

1. Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` with actual values.
2. Replace `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with actual port numbers.
3. I've assumed the `workspace_app` volume is a persistent volume that needs to be claimed. Therefore, I've created a `PersistentVolumeClaim`. If this is not appropriate, you'll need to adjust the volume configuration.
4. The local directories (`./log`, `./app_container/src`, etc.) are mapped to `hostPath` volumes in Kubernetes. You need to replace `/path/on/host/...` with the actual paths where the data will be stored on the host. If you're using a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, consider using a different type of volume that is accessible across nodes.
5. The `depends_on` directive is not directly translatable to Kubernetes. If you need to control startup order, you might want to use init containers or other mechanisms.
6. The `cap_add` and `security_opt` are translated to `securityContext` in Kubernetes, though they may not work exactly the same way.

Please validate and customize these manifests further based on the actual requirements of your environment and Kubernetes cluster setup.
