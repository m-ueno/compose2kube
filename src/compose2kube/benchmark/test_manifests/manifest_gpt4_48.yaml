To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, we need to create a set of Kubernetes resource definitions that replicate the configuration and behavior specified in the Compose file. Here, we will create a Deployment and a Service manifest for the `act-sdk_exec` container, and a PersistentVolumeClaim for the `workspace_app` volume. The other bind-mounted volumes will be represented by hostPath or ConfigMap/Secret, as appropriate.

Please note that Kubernetes does not support certain Docker-specific features such as `depends_on`, `cap_add`, and `security_opt` out of the box. For capabilities and security options, you might need to use PodSecurityPolicies or similar mechanisms depending on your Kubernetes cluster setup.

Below are the Kubernetes manifests that represent the Docker Compose file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Specify the size according to your needs

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # GUI port
        - containerPort: 5003 # Websocket port
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        - name: GUI_FWD_PORT
          value: "8002"
        - name: WSS_FWD_PORT
          value: "5003"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # The following hostPath volumes will mount paths from the host to the Pod.
      # This is often not recommended for production use and might require specific cluster configurations.
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/src
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: 8002
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: websocket
    port: 5003
    targetPort: 5003
  type: NodePort # Or LoadBalancer if you're using a cloud provider
```

Please replace the `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` placeholders with the appropriate values for your container image. You will also need to adjust the `hostPath` volumes to point to the correct paths on your Kubernetes nodes, as this setup assumes that the files are present on all nodes in the same location.

Remember to apply these manifests with `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml` and adjust any configurations such as storage sizes, access modes, host paths, and other parameters to fit the specific needs of your application and cluster environment.
