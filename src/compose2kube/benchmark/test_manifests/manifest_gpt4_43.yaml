To convert your Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you'll need to create several Kubernetes objects like `Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`, etc. Below is an example of how you can translate your Docker Compose service to Kubernetes manifests.

Keep in mind that you'll need to replace environment-specific variables (like `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}`) with actual values or you can handle them using ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: <REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_FULL_IMAGE_NAME>
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
          seLinuxOptions:
            type: spc_t # equivalent to `seccomp:unconfined` but must be verified
        command:
          - "/bin/sh"
          - "-c"
          - "cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/host/log
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/host/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/host/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/host/add_components/websocket_sv
```

For the `Service` to expose the ports:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: <REPLACE_WITH_GUI_FWD_PORT>
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: <REPLACE_WITH_WSS_FWD_PORT>
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
```

For the `PersistentVolumeClaim` (assuming you need persistent storage):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Please note that this is a very basic conversion and does not take into account more advanced settings and configurations. You might need to adjust security contexts, resource limits, liveness/readiness probes, and other Kubernetes-specific settings. Also, `hostPath` volumes are used for simplicity, but in a production environment, you would likely use a more robust storage solution. 

For the `depends_on` directive, you will need to handle inter-service dependencies within your application logic, as Kubernetes does not natively support this directive from Docker Compose files. You may need to implement readiness probes or init containers to ensure dependent services are available before starting a particular pod. 

Lastly, if you are looking to automate the conversion process, there are tools like Kompose that can help, though manual adjustments are often still necessary to fine-tune the resulting manifests for your specific use case.
