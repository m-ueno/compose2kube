To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, we will need to create a Deployment (or StatefulSet if you need stable storage and network identifiers), a Service to expose the ports, and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for the volumes if necessary.

Here's an example of how the Kubernetes manifests could look like for the given service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # GUI port
        - containerPort: 5003 # WebSocket port
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Please note the following:

1. Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with their respective values.
2. The `volumes` field in the deployment spec should be modified to match your volume provisioning strategy. I've used `PersistentVolumeClaim` for the `workspace-app` volume and `hostPath` for the other volumes, assuming that these files/directories exist on the host system where the pod will be scheduled.
3. The `depends_on` directive is not supported in Kubernetes. Instead, you can control the order of deployment using init containers or other mechanisms if needed.
4. The `restart: always` policy is default behavior in Kubernetes.
5. The `ports` field in the service spec should be modified to match the ports you wish to expose.

Please adjust the manifests according to your specific requirements, such as storage class for PVCs, resource limits, and other configurations. This YAML is a starting point and may require further refinement for production use.
