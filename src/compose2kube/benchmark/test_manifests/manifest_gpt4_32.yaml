To convert the given Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you'll need to create several Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim. Below is a basic translation of your Compose file to Kubernetes YAML manifests.

Please note that this translation assumes that you have an existing PersistentVolume or dynamic provisioning set up for the `workspace_app` volume. Also, note that for environment variables like `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}`, you will need to replace them with actual values or use Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets to inject them.

```yaml

        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: /workspace/app-base/src:/workspace
        volumeMounts:

        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/src
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/configs
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/websocket_sv

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Please replace the placeholder paths for `hostPath` volumes with the actual paths on your Kubernetes nodes, and adjust the `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `PersistentVolume` to match your storage requirements. Also, if your cluster supports dynamic provisioning, you don't need to manually create the `PersistentVolume`.

For `security_opt` with `seccomp:unconfined`, you can set the `seLinuxOptions` in the `securityContext` to a permissive type, but you need to carefully consider the security implications of this.

For the `depends_on` directive, Kubernetes does not have a native equivalent, but you can use init containers, readiness probes, or other orchestration logic to manage dependencies between services.
