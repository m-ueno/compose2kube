To convert the provided Docker Compose file into Kubernetes manifests, you can create a Deployment, Service, PersistentVolumeClaim, and ConfigMap as needed. Here is a basic conversion based on the provided Docker Compose file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: /workspace/app-base/src:/workspace
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seLinuxOptions:
            type: spc_t # This is a permissive type, similar to unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/log # Change to the appropriate path on the host
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Change the storage size as needed
```

This YAML file contains a Deployment, a Service, and a PersistentVolumeClaim. Here are the caveats and notes:

1. `depends_on` is not directly translatable to Kubernetes. Instead, you can use init containers, readiness probes, or simply manage the dependencies manually.
2. Environment variables with `${VARIABLE}` syntax should be replaced with actual values or provided through a ConfigMap or Secret in Kubernetes.
3. Persistent volumes are not defined here. The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) `workspace-app-pvc` would need an actual PersistentVolume (PV) or use a dynamic provisioner like those found in cloud environments.
4. `cap_add` and `security_opt` are translated into security contexts within Kubernetes. Please note that giving SYS_ADMIN capabilities and using a permissive SELinux type `spc_t` (or `unconfined`) can be a security risk and should be carefully considered.
5. `ports` in the Service should have the actual values from the environment variables `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` filled in.
6. The `hostPath` volumes are used for simplicity. In production, consider using other volume types that are suitable for your environment, and ensure that the paths are correctly set to your host directories.
7. The `entrypoint` from the Docker Compose has been translated into `command` and `args` in the Kubernetes manifest.

Make sure to replace the placeholders (like `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}`) with actual values that are appropriate for your setup before applying this manifest. Also, you need to adjust the storage class and permissions as necessary for your specific Kubernetes environment.
