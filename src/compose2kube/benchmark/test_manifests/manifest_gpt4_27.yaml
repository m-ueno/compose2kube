The provided Docker Compose file describes a service named `act-sdk_exec` with various configurations such as image, environment variables, volumes, etc. To convert this to Kubernetes manifests, we will create a Deployment and a Service for the `act-sdk_exec` service. Note that the Docker Compose `depends_on` field does not have a direct equivalent in Kubernetes, as Kubernetes will start all the pods in parallel and expects the applications to handle their dependencies.

The following is an example of how you might convert the Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests. Keep in mind that this is a basic conversion and additional adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific requirements of your application and your Kubernetes environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        emptyDir: {} # You need to define the correct volume source depending on your needs
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log # Replace with the correct host path
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/src # Replace with the correct host path
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/configs # Replace with the correct host path
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/websocket_sv # Replace with the correct host path

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP # Or NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc., depending on your needs
```

A few important notes:

1. Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the actual values.
2. The Docker Compose `volumes` have been converted to Kubernetes volumes using `emptyDir` and `hostPath`. You may want to use Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) in a production environment.
3. The `tty: true` is translated into `stdin` and `tty` being set to `true` in the container spec.
4. The `restart: always` policy in Docker is equivalent to the restart policy of `Always` in Kubernetes, which is the default for deployments.
5. The `depends_on` field is not represented here because Kubernetes pods are created in parallel; inter-pod dependencies need to be managed by the application logic or by using readiness probes.
6. For the security context, the `cap_add` and `security_opt` fields are translated to the appropriate Kubernetes `securityContext` settings.
7. The `entrypoint` is split into `command` and `args` in the Kubernetes container spec.
