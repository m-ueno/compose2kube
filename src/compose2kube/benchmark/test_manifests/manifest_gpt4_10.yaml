To convert the Docker Compose file into Kubernetes manifests, you'd need to create several different kinds of Kubernetes resources like Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, PersistentVolumeClaims, etc.

Here's an example of how you might convert the provided snippet into Kubernetes manifests:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # GUI port
        - containerPort: 5003 # Websocket port
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # Host volume (log) - for illustrative purposes, consider using PV/PVC for production
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/log
      # Host volume (src) - for illustrative purposes, consider using PV/PVC for production
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/src
      # Host volume (configs) - for illustrative purposes, consider using PV/PVC for production
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/configs
      # Host volume (websocket-sv) - for illustrative purposes, consider using PV/PVC for production
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: 8002
    targetPort: 8002
    nodePort: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
  - name: wss
    port: 5003
    targetPort: 5003
    nodePort: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
```

Please note the following:

1. You need to replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with actual values.
2. I used a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for the `workspace_app` volume and `hostPath` for other volumes. In a production environment, you would want to use PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PVCs according to your storage requirements.
3. `NodePort` service type is used here. Change it as per your requirement; if you're using a cloud provider, you might want to use `LoadBalancer` or `ClusterIP` with Ingress.
4. The `depends_on` field from Docker Compose is not directly translatable to Kubernetes. You'd need to manage inter-container dependencies within the same pod or use readiness and liveness probes for inter-pod dependencies.
5. `seccomp:unconfined` and `cap_add` are translated into the `securityContext` for the container.
6. I've added `env` for the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` as specified in the Compose file.
7. The `entrypoint` from the Compose file is split into `command` and `args` in the Kubernetes yaml.
8. Adjust the resources under the PVC spec to match your storage requirements.

Remember, this is a starting point and will likely require further tweaking to suit the specific environment and use cases. Always review and adjust the generated manifests according to best practices and the particular requirements of your deployment environment.
