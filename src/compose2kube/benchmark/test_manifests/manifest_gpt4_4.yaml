Below is an example of how you might convert the provided Docker Compose configuration to Kubernetes manifests. Please note that this is a basic conversion, and you may need to further tweak the resulting YAML files to suit your specific deployment environment and requirements.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec-container
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
          seLinuxOptions:
            type: spc_t
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/log
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Notes:**

1. Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` with your actual image registry, repository, and image name.

2. Replace `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the actual port numbers you want to expose.

3. The `volumes` section in the Deployment manifest includes `hostPath` volumes for simplicity, but you should replace these with your desired type of persistent storage (like NFS, cloud-based storage, etc.).

4. The `securityContext` field includes a `capabilities` block with `SYS_ADMIN`, but this is often discouraged in a Kubernetes environment for security reasons. Make sure this is absolutely necessary for your application and acceptable in your deployment environment.

5. The `restart: always` policy in Docker Compose translates to a Kubernetes Deployment which inherently has a restart policy of `Always`.

6. `depends_on` is not directly translatable to Kubernetes, but if `act-sdk_app` is another service that needs to start before `act-sdk_exec`, you would create another Deployment for it and might need to handle service dependencies through readiness probes, init containers, or other orchestration mechanisms.

7. The conversion assumes `/path/to/log`, `/path/to/app_container/src`, `/path/to/app_container/configs`, and `/path/to/add_components/websocket_sv` are paths on the Kubernetes nodes. You should adjust these paths as necessary to match your cluster's configuration.

8. The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a basic setup. You may need to configure StorageClasses or adjust the access modes and storage requests according to your cluster's storage provisioner and requirements.

Remember to adjust the manifest according to your actual deployment needs and best practices for your Kubernetes environment.
