To convert the provided Docker Compose file into Kubernetes manifests, you would need to create a set of Kubernetes resource files, such as Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims, etc. Here's an example of how you might convert the given Compose file into Kubernetes manifests:

1. Define a PersistentVolumeClaim for the `workspace_app` volume. Since we don't have the full storage details, I'll assume a default storage class and a small size for demonstration purposes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

2. Define a Deployment for the `act-sdk_exec` service. You will need to replace the placeholders `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with actual values.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: exec-container
          image: <REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY>/<MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE> # Replace with actual value
          tty: true
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8002 # Replace <GUI_FWD_PORT> with actual value
            - containerPort: 5003 # Replace <WSS_FWD_PORT> with actual value
          env:
            - name: PYTHONPATH
              value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: workspace-app
              mountPath: /workspace/app
            - name: log-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
            - name: src-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/src
            - name: configs-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
            - name: websocket-sv-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
            seccompProfile:
              type: Unconfined
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
        - name: workspace-app
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: workspace-app-pvc
        # The following volumes must be defined based on your cluster's storage options. Here, they are shown as emptyDir for simplicity.
        - name: log-volume
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: src-volume
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: configs-volume
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          emptyDir: {}
```

3. Define Services for the exposed ports. You'll need to create two Services to expose ports `8002` and `5003`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-gui
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: <GUI_FWD_PORT> # Replace with actual value
      targetPort: 8002
  type: ClusterIP

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-wss
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: <WSS_FWD_PORT> # Replace with actual value
      targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
```

Remember to replace the placeholders with the actual values before applying the manifests to your Kubernetes cluster. Also, you'll need to address the `depends_on` directive from the Compose file, since Kubernetes does not have a direct equivalent. You'll typically handle inter-service dependencies through readiness and liveness probes or init containers.

Additionally, the volumes specified as local paths (e.g., `./log`, `./app_container/src`, etc.) will need to be mapped to storage solutions that are appropriate for your Kubernetes environment, such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, or PersistentVolumes backed by a suitable storage class.

Please note that this is just a basic conversion, and you may need to adjust the manifests further based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your Kubernetes environment.
