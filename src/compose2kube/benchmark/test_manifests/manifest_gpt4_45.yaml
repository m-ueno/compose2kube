Converting a Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests involves creating several different Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims, ConfigMaps, etc. Below is an example of how you could convert the provided Docker Compose snippet into Kubernetes YAML manifests.

Please note that this is a basic conversion and may need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your Kubernetes cluster and requirements.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # The following hostPath volumes should be used for development purposes only.
      # For production, consider using PersistentVolumeClaims or ConfigMaps instead.
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/log
          type: Directory
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/src
          type: Directory
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/configs
          type: Directory
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv
          type: Directory
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  type: NodePort # or LoadBalancer if you want to expose it outside the cluster
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8002
    targetPort: 8002
    nodePort: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
  - name: wss-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 5003
    targetPort: 5003
    nodePort: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust this value as needed
```

Please make the following adjustments:

1. Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` with the correct image details.
2. Replace `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the actual port numbers you want to use for NodePort service type. Alternatively, if you want to use a LoadBalancer service type to expose your service to the outside of the Kubernetes cluster, remove the `nodePort` configuration.
3. Update the volume definitions based on how you want to handle persistent storage in your cluster. The example above uses `hostPath` for simplicity, but this should only be used for development purposes. For production, you should use `PersistentVolumeClaims` or other storage options.
4. The `depends_on` field is not directly supported in Kubernetes, so make sure that your application can handle waiting for its dependencies to be ready or use an init container to wait for dependencies.
5. The `restart: always` policy in Compose translates to the default restart policy of `Always` in Kubernetes Deployments.
6. The `cap_add` and `security_opt` settings have been translated to the equivalent Kubernetes security context, but you should review these settings and adjust them according to your security policies and cluster capabilities.

Please review and test these manifests carefully, as direct translation from Compose to Kubernetes might not capture all nuances of your deployment.
