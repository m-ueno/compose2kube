To convert the given Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you'll need to create a Deployment, Service, PersistentVolumeClaim, and potentially a ConfigMap or Secret for environment variables. Below is an example of how you might convert your Compose file to Kubernetes YAML manifests.

Please note that some fields might need to be adapted based on your specific Kubernetes cluster setup, such as storage class for the PersistentVolumeClaim or specific security contexts.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec-container
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: "/workspace/app"
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: "/workspace/app/exec/log"
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: "/workspace/app/src"
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: "/workspace/app/exec/configs"
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: "/workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv"
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # Host path volumes for ./log, ./app_container/src, etc.
      # You will need to replace these with PersistentVolumeClaims if necessary
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  # Uncomment and set the storageClassName according to your cluster's StorageClass
  # storageClassName: standard
```

Please replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with actual values from your environment.

This manifest assumes that you're using hostPath for some volumes, which maps a directory from the host node's filesystem into the pod. This is typically only suitable for single-node clusters or for development and testing purposes. In a multi-node cluster, you would want to use PersistentVolumes that are accessible to all nodes, like NFS, or cloud provider-specific storage solutions.

Lastly, the `depends_on` field from Docker Compose is not directly translatable to Kubernetes. In Kubernetes, if you need to control the startup order of your containers, you might need to use init containers or other synchronization mechanisms.
