To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, we need to create a Deployment, a Service, a PersistentVolumeClaim, and potentially a ConfigMap or Secret for environment variables and sensitive data. Since there's not enough context for the entire setup, I'll make some assumptions and provide a basic conversion.

Please note that Kubernetes does not support Docker Compose's `depends_on`, `cap_add`, `security_opt`, `tty`, and `restart` fields directly. Instead, we need to use Kubernetes' native fields and resources to achieve similar functionality.

Below is an example of how you might convert the provided Compose file to a Kubernetes Deployment and Service, along with a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec-container
        image: <registry>/<repository>/<main_exec_image> # Replace with your actual image
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          privileged: true # This is not recommended in production!
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/log # Replace with the actual path on your host
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/app_container/src
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/your/add_components/websocket_sv

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui
    port: 8002
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss
    port: 5003
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Specify the appropriate storage size
```

This example assumes that the volumes you've specified are mapped to the host's filesystem. You may need to adjust the `hostPath` or use other types of volumes depending on where and how you want to store your data.

Please also be aware that setting `privileged: true` is not recommended for production environments due to security concerns. You would typically want to find alternative methods to grant necessary permissions to your containers in a more secure manner.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `<registry>/<repository>/<main_exec_image>` with the actual values of your Docker image and adjust the host paths for your volumes to match your environment. Additionally, you should adjust the storage size for the PersistentVolumeClaim according to your needs.

Remember, this is just a basic conversion and might not meet all your requirements. You may need to customize the manifests further to match your exact setup and configurations.
