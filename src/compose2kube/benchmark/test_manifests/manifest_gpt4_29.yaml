To convert the provided Docker Compose file snippet to Kubernetes manifests, we'll need to create a Kubernetes Deployment, Service, PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and potentially ConfigMap or Secrets if necessary for environment variables and volumes.

Below is the Kubernetes manifest based on the provided Docker Compose snippet. Note that this manifest is a starting point and might need adjustments based on your specific Kubernetes environment and requirements, such as storage class for PVCs, namespace, resource requests and limits, etc.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8002 # Replace with the actual value of ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
          - containerPort: 5003 # Replace with the actual value of ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
        env:
          - name: PYTHONPATH
            value: /workspace/app-base/src:/workspace
        volumeMounts:
          - name: workspace-app
            mountPath: /workspace/app
          - name: log-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
          - name: src-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/app/src
          - name: configs-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
          - name: websocket-sv-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
        - name: workspace-app
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: workspace-app-pvc
        - name: log-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/log # Replace with the actual host path
        - name: src-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/app_container/src # Replace with the actual host path
        - name: configs-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/app_container/configs # Replace with the actual host path
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv # Replace with the actual host path

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - name: gui-port
      protocol: TCP
      port: 8002 # Replace with the actual port number
      targetPort: 8002
    - name: wss-port
      protocol: TCP
      port: 5003 # Replace with the actual port number
      targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust the size as needed
```

Please note the following points:
1. You need to replace the placeholder `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` with the actual values for the image.
2. The environment variables `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` should be replaced with their actual values.
3. I've assumed that `workspace_app` will be backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). You will need to define the storage class and size according to your cluster's provisioner.
4. The `depends_on` directive is not directly translatable in Kubernetes manifests. Dependencies must be managed by the application itself, by using init containers, or through other orchestration logic.
5. HostPath volumes are used for simplicity, but in a production environment, you should consider using other types of volumes that are appropriate for your setup.
6. You need to replace the host path volumes with the actual paths of your host system.
7. The `securityContext` is used to grant the `SYS_ADMIN` capability and disable the `seccomp` profile. Be aware that granting `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities can be a security risk and should be carefully considered.

Please review and adjust the manifests to fit your specific needs and environment.
