To convert the given Docker Compose file snippet to Kubernetes manifests, we'll need to create several Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), etc.

Please be aware that Kubernetes does not have a built-in equivalent to `depends_on`, `tty`, `restart`, `cap_add`, or `security_opt`. Some of these features can be replicated with Kubernetes features or may not be necessary.

Here is an example of what the Kubernetes manifests could look like for the provided Docker Compose service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/log
      - name: src
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/src
      - name: configs
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/add_components/websocket_sv
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: LoadBalancer

# PVC for workspace_app volume
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Please replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the appropriate values for your setup.

Also, note the following:
- I've created a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for the `workspace_app` volume. You'll need to make sure that the PVC is properly provisioned and that it matches the storage needs of your application.
- The `hostPath` volumes are used for the other volume mount points. This is for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would typically use a more resilient storage solution.
- The `seccomp:unconfined` and `cap_add` are translated to a `securityContext` with added capabilities. Make sure that your Kubernetes cluster supports these security settings, as they may require privileged access.
- The `Service` is of type `LoadBalancer`, which will provision an external IP to access your service. This may incur additional costs in cloud environments.

Remember to replace the placeholders for volume `hostPath` with the actual paths on your nodes where the data should be stored. Also, you should adjust the deployment configuration according to your security and resilience requirements.
