To convert the Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you will need to create several Kubernetes objects such as Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PersistentVolumeClaim, and PersistentVolume as needed. Below is a basic conversion of the provided Compose file into Kubernetes manifests.

First, we need the Deployment which will define the pods that run the containers:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # Define other volumes here
```

Next, define the PersistentVolumeClaim for the `workspace_app` volume. Other volumes should be defined similarly if they require persistence:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Now, create a Service to expose the `act-sdk-exec` Deployment. This is for the ports that were specified in the Docker Compose file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - name: gui-port
      protocol: TCP
      port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
      targetPort: 8002
    - name: wss-port
      protocol: TCP
      port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
      targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP
```

Please note that for the variables like `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}`, you will need to replace them with actual values or provide them through a ConfigMap, Secret, or directly in the manifest.

Also, for the volumes that map to local directories (e.g., `./log`, `./app_container/src`, etc.), you would need to either create PersistentVolumes that point to existing storage, or use ConfigMaps or other mechanisms if the data doesn't need to be persistent.

This example is a basic translation, and there might be additional considerations depending on your exact needs, such as handling `depends_on` which requires readiness probes or init containers to ensure dependencies are up before starting a container. Also, the `cap_add` and `security_opt` fields might require additional security policies depending on your Kubernetes cluster's configuration.
