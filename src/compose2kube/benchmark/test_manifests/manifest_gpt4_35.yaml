To convert the provided Docker Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, you'll need to create a Deployment, Service, and PersistentVolumeClaim for the stateful parts of the application.

Below are the basic Kubernetes manifests that correspond to the Docker Compose file you've provided. Please note that you'll need to replace `${VARIABLES}` with actual values or use ConfigMaps or Secrets to inject them in your Kubernetes environment.

**Deployment:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: exec-container
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002 # GUI port
        - containerPort: 5003 # Websocket port
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["SYS_ADMIN"]
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      # Define other volumes using hostPath or preferred persistent volume sources
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/src
      - name: config-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv
```

**Service:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP # or use NodePort, LoadBalancer as per requirement
```

**PersistentVolumeClaim:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust the size as needed
```

Please replace the placeholders such as `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with the actual values. Additionally, you'll need to configure the volume sources correctly, considering that hostPath volumes are for single-node clusters and you might want to use different volume types for multi-node clusters, like NFS, cloud provider volumes, etc.

Remember that this conversion assumes a simple one-to-one translation of services to deployments and does not take into account the full complexity of your application or its dependencies. If `act-sdk_app` is another service that your `act-sdk_exec` depends on, you'll need to create similar manifests for that service as well. Also, the `depends_on` directive is not directly translatable to Kubernetes; you'll need to handle inter-service dependencies through proper readiness and liveness probes or init containers.
