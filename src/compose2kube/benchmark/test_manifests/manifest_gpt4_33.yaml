To convert the provided Docker Compose YAML to Kubernetes manifests, we'll need to create several Kubernetes resources including a Deployment, Service, PersistentVolume (if needed), and PersistentVolumeClaim.

Here's an approximate conversion of the provided Docker Compose YAML into Kubernetes manifests:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: act-sdk-exec
        image: ${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}
        tty: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8002
        - containerPort: 5003
        env:
        - name: PYTHONPATH
          value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: workspace-app
          mountPath: /workspace/app
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
        - name: src-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/src
        - name: configs-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd /workspace/app/src && python3 SampleApp.py"]
      volumes:
      - name: workspace-app
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: workspace-app-pvc
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/log # Replace with the actual path on the host
      - name: src-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/src # Replace with the actual path on the host
      - name: configs-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs # Replace with the actual path on the host
      - name: websocket-sv-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv # Replace with the actual path on the host

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
  - name: gui-port
    port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 8002
  - name: wss-port
    port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
    targetPort: 5003
  type: LoadBalancer # or ClusterIP, depending on your needs

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Specify the size of the PVC
```

Please note:
- Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}`, `${GUI_FWD_PORT}`, and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}` with actual values.
- The `ports` and `environment` fields from the Docker Compose file are converted into `ports` and `env` in the Kubernetes deployment.
- The `volumes` are set up with `hostPath` for simplicity, but you might want to use PersistentVolumes or other types of volumes depending on your cluster's storage configuration and requirements.
- The `depends_on` field from Docker Compose is not directly translatable to Kubernetes. You might need to handle inter-container dependencies with init containers or other mechanisms.
- The `cap_add` and `security_opt` fields are translated into the corresponding fields in the `securityContext` of the Kubernetes deployment.
- The `entrypoint` and `command` fields have been split into `command` and `args` in the Kubernetes deployment.

Before applying these manifests, you'll need to replace placeholders with actual values and adjust the volume configuration according to your environment and storage needs. Make sure to create the necessary PersistentVolume resources if you are using PersistentVolumeClaims that are not dynamically provisioned.
