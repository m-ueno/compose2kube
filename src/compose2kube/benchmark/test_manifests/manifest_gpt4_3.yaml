To convert the given Compose file to Kubernetes manifests, we would create a Deployment, a Service, and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for the volumes if needed. Below are the Kubernetes manifests that correspond to the provided Docker Compose file:

1. PersistentVolumeClaim for `workspace_app`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: workspace-app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # You should specify the required size
```

2. Deployment for `act-sdk_exec`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: act-sdk-exec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: act-sdk-exec
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: act-sdk-exec
          image: "${REGISTRY}/${REPOSITORY}/${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}"
          tty: true
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add:
                - SYS_ADMIN
            seccompProfile:
              type: Unconfined
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8002 # GUI port
            - containerPort: 5003 # Websocket port
          env:
            - name: PYTHONPATH
              value: "/workspace/app-base/src:/workspace"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: workspace-app
              mountPath: /workspace/app
            # Mount your other volumes as needed
            - name: log-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/log
            - name: src-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/src
            - name: configs-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app/exec/configs
            - name: websocket-sv-volume
              mountPath: /workspace/app-base/src/app_base/parts/websocket_sv
          workingDir: /workspace/app/src
          command:
            - "/bin/sh"
            - "-c"
            - "python3 SampleApp.py"
      volumes:
        - name: workspace-app
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: workspace-app-pvc
        # Define other volumes here, for example using ConfigMap, Secret, or hostPath
        - name: log-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/on/host/log # Update this path
        - name: src-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/on/host/app_container/src # Update this path
        - name: configs-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/on/host/app_container/configs # Update this path
        - name: websocket-sv-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /path/on/host/add_components/websocket_sv # Update this path
```

3. Service for `act-sdk_exec`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: act-sdk-exec-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: act-sdk-exec
  ports:
    - name: gui
      port: ${GUI_FWD_PORT}
      targetPort: 8002
    - name: wss
      port: ${WSS_FWD_PORT}
      targetPort: 5003
  type: ClusterIP # Change to NodePort or LoadBalancer if external access is required
```

Please note the following:

- Replace `${REGISTRY}`, `${REPOSITORY}`, and `${MAIN_EXEC_IMAGE}` with the actual values.
- Update storage size for `workspace-app-pvc` according to your needs.
- The `depends_on` directive from Docker Compose does not have a direct equivalent in Kubernetes. Dependencies are typically managed by readiness and liveness probes.
- The `ports` in the service definition should have the actual values replaced for `${GUI_FWD_PORT}` and `${WSS_FWD_PORT}`.
- The `environment` variables are set using the `env` field in the container spec.
- The `volumes` in Docker Compose are converted to `volumeMounts` in the container spec and `volumes` at the pod level. The PVC `workspace-app` is created and mounted. The other volume mounts are placeholders using `hostPath` for illustration, but you may need to adjust them according to your cluster's storage provisioner or use ConfigMaps/Secrets if applicable.
- The `cap_add` and `security_opt` are set using `securityContext` in the container spec.
- The `entrypoint` is converted to `command` and `args` in the container spec.

Make sure to tailor the manifests according to your specific Kubernetes cluster setup, storage provisioning, and networking requirements.
